**Outcome of Project 1**
**Objective:**
For Project 1, the group will select a dataset and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) within a specific industry of interest. The analysis will aim to uncover insights, answer predefined research questions, and produce professional-grade visualizations and conclusions.

**Steps and Deliverables:**
**Collaboration:**

Establish clear communication channels (e.g., Slack, GitHub Projects).
Set internal milestones and timelines for project components:
Proposal drafting
Data collection and integration
Data cleaning and exploration
Analysis and visualizations
Presentation preparation

**Project Proposal:**

Identify the dataset and industry focus (e.g., finance, healthcare, or custom).
Define research questions aligned with the chosen data.
Specify data sources (e.g., Kaggle, data.gov).

**Data Exploration and Cleaning:**

Clean and reformat raw data to ensure consistency and usability.
Document all steps in a dedicated Jupyter notebook for transparency.

**Analysis:**

Apply analytical techniques such as:
Aggregation, correlation, and comparison
Summary statistics and time-series analysis
Generate insights through 6–8 high-quality visualizations.
